# **Cylistic Case Study: Google Data Analytics**
This is my first data analysis project, completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

## **Scenario**

I am an analyst working for Cyclistic, a bike-share company. My objective is to analyze ride data from the past year to identify key differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual users into long-term members.

## **Tools Used**

- **SQL**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation. You can find all my scripts in the sql_queries folder.

- **Tableau**: Used for data visualization and building the final report.

## **Project Deliverables**

- **Raw & Cleaned Data**: Available in the [data](./data) folder.

- **Final Report (PDF)**: [Final report](./Cyclistics_an_users_overview.pdf)

- **Dashboard Screenshots**: Avaible in the [dashboard](./dashboard)
