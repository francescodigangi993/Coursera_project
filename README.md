# Coursera project
My first work, the case study from Coursera "Google Data Analytics". In this scenario i'm an analyst working for Cyclistics a rent bike company. My objective is analyze the data of the rides of the last year for find the difference in use between member and casual users. 

For this project I use:

SQL: for cleaning and elaborate data.

You can find all the queries i used in [sql_queries](./sql_queries) and the data before and after cleaning in [data](./data)

Tableau: for create the report
